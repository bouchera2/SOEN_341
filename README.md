SOEN 341 project FALL 2025


# Project Description
You are implementing a Campus Events & Ticketing Web Application designed to help students discover, organize, and attend events on campus. The system enables students to browse events, save them, claim free or paid tickets, and check in using QR codes. Organizers can create and manage events, track attendance, and access analytics through dashboards, while administrators moderate content and oversee organizations. The application streamlines event management, improves student engagement, and provides valuable insights for both organizers and campus administration.

As an example, you can take a look at: https://www.campusgroups.com

##**Core Features** 
We identify three primary users: Students, Organizers, and Administrators.

**1. Student Event Experience**

Save events to a personal calendar.

Claim tickets (free or mock paid).

Receive a digital ticket with a unique QR code.

**2. Organizer Event Management**
Event Creation

Enter event details: title, description, date/time, location, ticket capacity, ticket type (free or paid).

Event Analytics

Dashboard per event with stats: tickets issued, attendance rates, and remaining capacity.

Integrated QR scanner for ticket validation (for simplicity, you can assume the QR code image can be provided via file upload).
